I am a Data Engineer with 4+ years of experience designing, building, and optimizing scalable, cloud-native data platforms across healthcare, finance, and other domains. My work focuses on transforming raw, high-volume data into reliable, governed, and analytics-ready datasets that enable real-time insights and data-driven decision-making.

Currently, I work as a Data Engineer at Kinaxis in Chicago, where I design and implement enterprise-grade data pipelines on Azure using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, ADLS Gen2, Apache Airflow, and Delta Lake. I build medallion-style lakehouse architectures that support ACID transactions, incremental processing, and high data quality standards while ensuring security, lineage, and governance across the data ecosystem.

Previously at CitiusTech, I worked on large-scale healthcare data platforms processing 25+ million patient records daily. I optimized Spark workloads using advanced partitioning strategies, predicate pushdown, and memory tuning, reducing processing time by over 35% and significantly improving BI performance. I also built reusable data quality frameworks using PySpark and Great Expectations, helping teams detect anomalies early and maintain 99.8% data accuracy in HIPAA-compliant environments.

Earlier in my career at Vision Software Solutions, I helped establish foundational data infrastructure by building centralized data warehouses, automating ETL workflows using Python and SQL, and enabling self-service analytics through Power BI dashboards. This experience strengthened my understanding of data modeling, KPI standardization, and business-focused reporting.

I am hands-on with Python, PySpark, SQL, Apache Spark, Airflow, Kafka, Azure, AWS, Delta Lake, Snowflake, and Power BI, and I hold Databricks Data Engineer Associate and Microsoft Fabric Data Engineer Associate certifications. I enjoy solving complex data problems, improving system reliability, and building platforms that scale with business needs.

I am actively seeking Data Engineer / Cloud Data Engineer opportunities where I can contribute to building robust data platforms, work on modern lakehouse architectures, and collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver real business impact.
